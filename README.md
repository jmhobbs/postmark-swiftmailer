This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/postmark-swiftmailer

It hasn't changed in a while, and I needed one of these, so I forked it and brought it over to github.

# Usge

    require_once '/path/to/swift-mailer/lib/swift_required.php';
    require_once '/path/to/postmark_swiftmailer.php';
    
    $transport = Swift_PostmarkTransport::newInstance('YOUR-POSTMARK-API-KEY')
    $mailer = Swift_Mailer::newInstance($transport);
    $message = Swift_Message::newInstance('Wonderful Subject')
                 ->setFrom(array('sender@mydomain.com' => 'John Doe'))
                 ->setTo(array('receiver@otherdomain.org' => 'Jane Doe'))
                 ->setBody('Here is the message itself');
    
    $mailer->send($message);
